## IP Addresses: The Basics 🤖💡

### 1\. IPv4 vs. IPv6: A Quick Overview 🌐🔤

* **IPv4:**
    
    * Format: \[0-255\].\[0-255\].\[0-255\].\[0-255\].
        
    * Capacity: 3.7 billion addresses in the public space.
        
* **IPv6:**
    
    * Format: 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf.
        
    * Addresses problems for the Internet of Things (IoT).
        

### 2\. AWS Focus: IPv4 🎯💻

* AWS primarily uses IPv4 in this course.
    
* IPv4 remains the dominant format online.
    

## Public vs. Private IPs: Drawing Boundaries 🏠🌐

### 1\. Key Distinctions 🌟🔒

* **Public IP:**
    
    * Identifiable on the internet (WWW).
        
    * Must be unique globally.
        
    * Easily geo-located.
        
* **Private IP:**
    
    * Identified only on a private network.
        
    * Must be unique within the private network.
        
    * Multiple private networks can share the same IPs.
        

### 2\. Elastic IPs: Stability in Dynamism 🌐🔄

* **Functionality:**
    
    * Ensures a fixed public IP for EC2 instances.
        
    * Attached to one instance at a time.
        
* **Considerations:**
    
    * Limit of 5 Elastic IPs per account.
        
    * Generally avoided for optimal architecture.
        
    * Suggested alternatives: random public IP with DNS or use a Load Balancer.
        

## Private and Public IPs in AWS EC2: Hands-On 🖥️🔧

### 1\. Default Configuration 🚀🌐

* **EC2 Defaults:**
    
    * Private IP for internal AWS network.
        
    * Public IP for [WWW](http://WWW).
        
* **SSH Considerations:**
    
    * Use public IP for SSH connections.
        
    * Public IP may change when an instance is stopped and started.
        

## Placement Groups: Strategic Instance Placement ⚖️🌐

### 1\. Control Strategies 🎯💼

* **Placement Groups:**
    
    * Define instance placement strategy.
        
    * Strategies: Cluster, Spread, Partition.
        
* **Use Cases:**
    
    * Cluster: Low latency, high network throughput (e.g., Big Data jobs).
        
    * Spread: High availability, isolated instances (e.g., critical applications).
        
    * Partition: Scales to 100s of instances, for distributed systems (e.g., Hadoop, Cassandra).
        

## Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI): Virtual Network Cards 🃏🔗

### 1\. ENI Characteristics 🌐📇

* **Attributes:**
    
    * Primary and secondary IPv4 addresses.
        
    * Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4.
        
    * Public IPv4.
        
    * Security groups.
        
    * MAC address.
        
* **Flexibility:**
    
    * Can be created independently and attached on-the-fly.
        
    * Bound to a specific availability zone.
        

## EC2 Hibernate: Navigating Instance States 🔄🛌

### 1\. Hibernate Functionality 🌐🔁

* **Key Points:**
    
    * Preserves in-memory (RAM) state.
        
    * Faster instance boot (RAM state not restarted).
        
    * RAM state stored in an encrypted file on the root EBS volume.
        
* **Use Cases:**
    
    * Long-running processing.
        
    * Services with extended initialization times.
        

### 2\. Considerations 🤔🔍

* **Supported Instances:**
    
    * Families: C3, C4, C5, I3, M3, M4, R3, R4, T2, T3, ...
        
    * RAM Size: Must be less than 150 GB.
        
    * Size: Not supported for bare metal instances.
        
* **Limitations:**
    
    * Hibernation not exceeding 60 days.
