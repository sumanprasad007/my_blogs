# **üìç Introduction:**

Looking for a sense of purpose and meaning in life is essential for everyone, especially for graduates who are entering a new phase in their lives. As Sadhguru suggests in his book, Inner Engineering, connecting with our inner selves through practices like meditation and introspection can help us identify our passions and talents. By focusing on giving to others, we can also create a positive impact on the world around us and experience a sense of fulfillment that cannot be found in self-centred pursuits. Finding our sense of purpose and meaning is crucial for our personal growth and fulfilment, and through self-reflection, we can discover our unique gifts and align them with meaningful contributions to the world.
