## 📍 Introduction:

Are you looking to migrate your AWS EC2 instance to an Azure Virtual Machine? Look no further! In this engaging blog post, we will outline the practical steps to migrate your production EC2 instance to an Azure VM using Azure Migrate with the help of an appliance server and the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool. Let's get started! 🎉

## 📍 Prerequisites:

Before diving in, make sure you have the following:

1. ✅ An active AWS account with an existing production EC2 instance
    
2. ✅ An active Azure account
    
3. ✅ Familiarity with AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, and Azure Migrate
    

### 🔧 Step 1: Set up Azure Migrate

1. Log in to the Azure portal ([https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/))
    
2. Click on "Create a resource" in the left-hand menu
    
3. Search for "Azure Migrate" and click on the result
    
4. Click the "Create" button
    
5. Select "Assess and migrate servers" and click "Create project"
    
6. Fill in the required information, such as subscription, resource group, and project name
    
7. Click "Create" to set up the Azure Migrate project
    

### 🖥️ Step 2: Set up the Azure Migrate appliance server on AWS

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Discover" under "Azure Migrate: Server Assessment"
    
2. Download the Azure Migrate appliance VHD for Hyper-V
    
3. Upload the VHD to an S3 bucket in your AWS account
    
4. Create an EC2 instance in AWS with the same or higher specifications as the production instance you want to migrate
    
5. Attach the uploaded VHD to the new EC2 instance as a secondary EBS volume
    
6. Start the EC2 instance and log in to the Azure Migrate appliance server
    

### 🔧 Step 3: Configure the appliance server

1. On the appliance server, open the Azure Migrate configuration manager
    
2. Sign in to your Azure account
    
3. Select the Azure Migrate project you created earlier
    
4. Configure the appliance server to discover the production EC2 instance by providing the required credentials and information
    

### 🔍 Step 4: Assess the production EC2 instance

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Assess" under "Azure Migrate: Server Assessment"
    
2. Review the assessment report to understand the readiness of the production EC2 instance for migration to Azure
    
3. Identify any issues or recommendations and address them before proceeding with the migration
    

### 🔄 Step 5: Set up Azure Migrate: Server Migration

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Discover" under "Azure Migrate: Server Migration"
    
2. Select the appliance server you set up earlier
    
3. Click "Discover" to discover the production EC2 instance
    

### 🚚 Step 6: Replicate the production EC2 instance to Azure

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Replicate" under "Azure Migrate: Server Migration"
    
2. Select the source (AWS) and the discovered production EC2 instance
    
3. Configure the target settings, such as subscription, resource group, virtual network, and VM size
    
4. Click "Replicate" to start replicating the production EC2 instance to an Azure VM
    

### 🧪 Step 7: Perform a test migration

1. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Test migrate" under "Azure Migrate: Server Migration"
    
2. Select the replicated VM and click "Test migrate"
    
3. Verify that the test migration is successful and that the Azure VM is functioning correctly
    

### ⏰ Step 8: Schedule downtime and perform the final migration

1. Schedule the downtime for the migration during a maintenance window or a period of low traffic
    
2. Inform all stakeholders about the planned downtime and the expected duration
    
3. During the scheduled downtime, perform the following steps: a. Stop all services on the EC2 instance to prevent data changes during the migration b. In the Azure Migrate project, click on "Migrate" under "Azure Migrate: Server Migration" c. Select the replicated VM and click "Migrate" d. Update DNS records or load balancers to point to the Azure VM instead of the EC2 instance e. Start services on the Azure VM and verify that everything is functioning correctly
    

### 🔎 Step 9: Monitor and decommission

1. Monitor the performance and functionality of the Azure VM to ensure that everything is running smoothly
    
2. Test the application and services to verify that they are working as expected
    
3. Once you have confirmed that the Azure VM is functioning correctly and all data has been migrated successfully, decommission the EC2 instance to avoid incurring additional costs
    

## 🎉 Conclusion:

Congratulations! By following these practical steps, you have successfully migrated your production AWS EC2 instance to an Azure Virtual Machine using Azure Migrate with the help of an appliance server and the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool. This approach minimizes downtime and ensures a smooth transition between the two cloud platforms. Happy migrating! 🚀
