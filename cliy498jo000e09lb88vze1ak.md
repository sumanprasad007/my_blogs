## **üìç** Introduction:

Azure Repos is a powerful tool that provides Git repositories for your projects, enabling seamless collaboration and version control. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of Git and version control, create a new Git repository in Azure Repos, and learn how to clone, commit, and push changes to the repository. Let's dive in!

### **üîç** Understanding Git and Version Control

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. It enables collaboration among team members, making it easier to manage and maintain codebases. Some key concepts in Git include:

* Repository: A collection of files and directories, along with their revision history.
    
* Commit: A snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time.
    
* Branch: A separate line of development within a repository.
    
* Merge: The process of combining changes from different branches.
    

### **üîç** Creating a New Git Repository in Azure Repos

To create a new Git repository in Azure Repos, follow these steps:

Step 1: Sign in to your Azure DevOps account and navigate to your project.

Step 2: Click on "Repos" in the left-hand menu.

Step 3: Click on the "+" icon next to "Repos" and select "New repository."

Step 4: Choose "Git" as the version control system, enter a name for your repository, and click "Create."

### **üîç** Cloning, Committing, and Pushing Changes to the Repository

Now that we have created a new Git repository in Azure Repos, let's learn how to clone, commit, and push changes to it.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

To clone the repository to your local machine, click on the "Clone" button in the Azure Repos interface. Copy the clone URL and open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine. Run the following command:

```plaintext
git clone <clone-url>
```

Replace **&lt;clone-url&gt;** with the URL you copied from Azure Repos.

Step 2: Commit Changes

Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and make changes to the files as needed. Once you have made your changes, run the following commands to stage and commit them:

```plaintext
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Replace "Your commit message" with a brief description of the changes you made.

Step 3: Push Changes to the Repository

To push your committed changes to the remote repository in Azure Repos, run the following command:

```plaintext
git push
```

This command will push your changes to the remote repository, making them available for other team members to access and collaborate on.

## **üìç** Conclusion:

In this blog post, we have explored the fundamentals of Git and version control, created a new Git repository in Azure Repos, and learned how to clone, commit, and push changes to the repository. By mastering these concepts and techniques, you can effectively collaborate with your team and manage your codebase using Azure Repos. Happy coding!
