# **üìç Introduction:**

Open AI, a leading research laboratory in artificial intelligence, recently launched its highly anticipated language model, ChatGPT-4. This launch came earlier than expected due to Google's announcement of implementing AI in its native software like Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Slides. Microsoft, to compete with Google's new announcements, decided to launch ChatGPT-4 ASAP.

**Google announced that they'll implement AI in their native software like:**

* * Gmail
        
    * ¬†Google Docs
        
    * Google Slides
        

If you want to learn more about ChatGPT-4, you can check out the official documentation from Open AI's website, available at [**https://openai.com/research/gpt-4**](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

ChatGPT-4 is designed to perform creative tasks more efficiently and process complex prompts with multiple filtrations. It is optimized for reasoning and conciseness, which makes it more accurate for complex prompts. However, it features a slower speed due to multiple filtration layers before producing results.

GPT-4 is only available for GPT plus users, which means paid members. If you're interested in getting your hands on ChatGPT-4, you can pay $20 to switch between default GPT-3.5, legacy GPT 3.5, and GPT-4. This will give you access to the latest features and enhancements.

## **üîπ GPT 3.5:**

# **üìç Limitations:**

However, there are a few limitations to ChatGPT-4, such as not providing information about its own version, using 2021 datasets, and not having the features of visual input and 25k word count input till now.

If you're interested in learning more about ChatGPT-4 and its capabilities, I recommend checking out the Open AI website and its research publications. You can also follow Open AI on social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in AI.

# **üìç Conclusion:**

With the release of GPT-4, OpenAI has taken a major step forward in the field of AI language models. The new features such as creativity, visual inputs, and longer context have opened up new possibilities for various industries to explore. The integration of GPT-4 by companies like Duolingo, Stripe, and Morgan Stanley shows the potential of this language model. However, it is important to note its limitations and that it is currently only available for paid members.
