# **📍** Introduction:

Ansible, an open-source automation tool, simplifies server management, configuration updates, and application deployments. In this blog post, we will explore the steps for installing Ansible, learn how to copy files to remote servers, configure server hosts and variables, execute commands on servers, and write Ansible playbooks for system configuration and package installations. Let's dive in!

### 🔧 What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT infrastructure management, configuration management, and application deployment. It provides a simple and agentless approach to automating tasks, making it easy to manage and control multiple servers from a single control node.

### 🌟 Why Use Ansible?

* 🚀 **Simplifies Automation**: Ansible eliminates the need for complex scripting and manual intervention, allowing you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations.
    
* 🌐 **Infrastructure Management**: With Ansible, you can define and manage infrastructure as code, making it easier to scale, replicate, and maintain infrastructure components.
    
* 🔧 **Configuration Management**: Ansible enables you to define the desired state of your systems, enforce configuration consistency, and perform system-wide updates effortlessly.
    
* 🚀 **Application Deployment**: Ansible facilitates the deployment of applications across multiple servers, ensuring consistency and reducing deployment time.
    
* 🔄 **Continuous Delivery**: Ansible integrates with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated deployments, testing, and rolling updates.
    

### 💡 How Ansible Solves Problems - Real-Time Example:

Imagine you have a web application running on multiple servers, and you need to perform a routine configuration update. Manually logging into each server and making the changes can be time-consuming and error-prone. Here's where Ansible comes to the rescue:

🎯 Problem: Manual Configuration Updates Let's say you need to update the Nginx configuration file across all servers.

### ✨ Ansible Solution:

1. 📝 **Playbook Creation**: Create an Ansible playbook, a YAML file that describes the desired state of the servers.
    
2. 📄 **Define Tasks**: Define tasks to copy the updated configuration file to the servers and restart the Nginx service.
    
3. 🔑 **Inventory Configuration**: Configure the inventory file to specify the target servers.
    
4. 🚀 **Run the Playbook**: Execute the playbook with a single command.
    

### **🔍 Step 1: Installing Ansible**

To begin, let's install Ansible on your control node using the following commands:

```plaintext
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

Now you have Ansible up and running, ready to automate your server management tasks.

## **🔍 Step 2: Copying Files to Remote Servers**

A common scenario is transferring files from your local machine to remote servers. For example, let's copy a `.pem` key to an Ubuntu server using the `scp` command:

```plaintext
scp -i "ansible-master.pem" /home/suman/Downloads/ansible-master.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-144-50-121.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/keys
```

This command securely copies the `.pem` key to the specified location on the remote server.

## **🔍 Step 3: Configuring Server Hosts and Variables**

To manage multiple servers, we need to configure them in the Ansible inventory file. Open the file using the following command:

```plaintext
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
```

Inside the file, define your server groups and variables. For example:

```plaintext
[dev-server]
My-server-1 ansible_host=public_ip

[prod-server]
My-server-2 ansible_host=public_ip

[dev-server:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/ansible-master.pem
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
ansible_user=ubuntu

[prod-server:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
ansible_user=ubuntu
```

Make sure to replace `public_ip` with the actual IP addresses of your servers. Save the file after making the necessary changes.

## **🔍 Step 4: Checking Server Authentication**

To verify if the authentication with servers is properly configured, we can use the `ping` module in Ansible. Run the following command:

```plaintext
ansible dev-server -m ping
```

This command will check the connectivity and authentication with the `dev-server` group.

## **🔍 Step 5: Executing Commands on Servers**

Ansible allows executing commands on remote servers easily. For example, to check the uptime of a server, use the following command:

```plaintext
ansible dev-server -a "uptime"
```

This command will display the uptime information for the servers in the `dev-server` group.

## **🔍 Step 6: Writing Ansible Playbooks**

Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format and define the desired state of the systems. Let's create a playbook to perform system configuration tasks. Create a file named `commands_play.yml`:

```plaintext
nano commands_play.yml
```

Inside the file, add the following playbook content:

```plaintext
---
- name: System configuration stats
  hosts: dev-server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Show date
      command: date

    - name: Checking uptime
      command: uptime
```

This playbook executes two tasks: displaying the current date and checking the server uptime.

## **🔍 Step 7: Running Ansible Playbooks**

To run the playbook and execute the defined tasks, use the following command:

```plaintext
ansible-playbook commands_play.yml -v
```

This command will execute the tasks defined in the playbook on the servers in the `dev-server` group.

## **🔍 Step 8: Installing Nginx on Servers**

We can also use Ansible to install packages on servers. For example, let's install Nginx on servers using a playbook. Create a file named `nginx_install.yml`:

```plaintext
---
- name: Install Nginx on server using Ansible
  hosts: dev-server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
```

This playbook installs the latest version of Nginx on the servers in the `dev-server` group.

## **🔍 Step 9: Deploying Web Pages with Ansible**

Ansible can also deploy files to remote servers. To deploy an `index.html` web page to a server, modify the playbook as follows:

```plaintext
---
- name: Install Nginx on server using Ansible
  hosts: prod-server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest

    - name: Starting the server
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Deploy Web Page
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/
```

This playbook installs Nginx, starts the service, and deploys the `index.html` file to the specified location.
