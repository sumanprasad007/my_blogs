# **üìç Introduction:**

Hello and welcome to today's class! In this blog, I will introduce you to the world of containers, and how they have revolutionized the world of software development.

## **üîπ** What is a VM?

First, let's start by discussing what a Virtual Machine (VM) is. A VM is a software program that simulates a complete computer system within a host operating system. It emulates the hardware of a computer, including the CPU, memory, storage, and network interface. Once the VM is installed on the host system, you can run another operating system (OS) within the VM as if it were running on its dedicated hardware.

## **üîπ** Problems with VM

While VMs have been around for many years, they are not without their drawbacks. One significant issue with VMs is that they can be slow and resource-intensive, particularly when you have multiple VMs running on the same host system. Each VM requires its own OS, which means that you must allocate a significant amount of memory and storage to each one. This can quickly become expensive and unwieldy, especially when you have to manage multiple VMs.

# **üìç** How Containers Solve the Problems with Docker?

Containers, on the other hand, are a lightweight alternative to VMs that provide a way to package and run applications in a self-contained environment. Containers are based on the concept of "isolation," which means that they provide a way to run multiple applications on the same host system without interfering with each other. This makes them an ideal solution for developers who need to run multiple instances of an application, or who want to create portable applications that can be deployed on any system.

Docker is one of the most popular container platforms available today. It provides an easy-to-use interface for building, packaging, and deploying containers. Docker containers are designed to be lightweight and portable, making them an ideal solution for running applications in a variety of environments, from development to production.

## **üîπ** What are a Container and Use-cases?

A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that contains everything an application needs to run, including the application code, libraries, and dependencies. Containers provide a way to package and deploy applications in a self-contained environment, making it easy to move them between different environments without worrying about dependencies or compatibility issues.

Containers have a wide range of use cases, from running microservices to deploying large-scale applications. They are also an ideal solution for developers who need to test their applications in different environments, as containers can be easily moved between development, testing, and production environments.

# **üìç** Docker Life Cycle

The Docker lifecycle consists of several stages, including:

1. Building: This involves creating a Docker image, which is a self-contained package that contains all the necessary dependencies to run an application.
    
2. Packaging: Once the Docker image has been built, it is packaged into a container that can be deployed on any system that supports Docker.
    
3. Deploying: The Docker container can be deployed on any system that supports Docker, including local machines, cloud platforms, or on-premise data centres.
    
4. Managing: Once the Docker container is running, it can be managed using a variety of tools, including Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
    

## **üîπ** Problems with Docker

While Docker is an incredibly powerful tool for deploying and managing containers, it is not without its drawbacks. One significant issue with Docker is that it can be challenging to manage large-scale container deployments, particularly when you have hundreds or thousands of containers running on multiple hosts.

# **üìç** Introduction to Buildah

A lightweight and flexible solution for container building. In recent years, containers have become an essential component of modern software development. They provide a way to package and deploy applications in a self-contained environment, making it easy to move them between different environments without worrying about dependencies or compatibility issues. However, managing containers at scale can be challenging, especially when it comes to building them.

To address some of the challenges with Docker, Red Hat created Buildah, an open-source tool for building containers. Buildah is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it an ideal solution for developers who want more control over the container build process. With Buildah, you can build containers without the need for a Docker daemon.

## **üîπ** Why use Buildah?

Buildah is a powerful tool that provides a range of benefits to developers, including:

1. Lightweight: Buildah is designed to be lightweight, making it an ideal solution for developers who want to build containers quickly and easily.
    
2. Flexible: Buildah provides a range of tools and features that make it easy to customize the container build process to meet your specific needs.
    
3. Control: With Buildah, developers have more control over the container build process, allowing them to optimize containers for their specific use case.
    
4. Security: Buildah provides a range of security features, including the ability to run builds in a secure containerized environment.
    

## **üîπ** Examples of using Buildah

1. Building a simple container: To build a simple container using Buildah, you can start by creating a new container image using the "from" command. For example:
    

```python
$ buildah from scratch
```

This command creates a new container image based on the "scratch" image, which is an empty image that contains no files or packages. You can then add files and packages to the container image using the "copy" and "run" commands, respectively.

1. Building a container with a custom base image: With Buildah, you can also create a custom base image for your containers. To do this, you can start by creating a new container image using the "from" command, and then add packages and files to the image using the "run" and "copy" commands. For example:
    

```python
$ buildah from fedora:latest
$ buildah run mycontainer dnf update -y
$ buildah run mycontainer dnf install -y nginx
$ buildah copy mycontainer index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

This command creates a new container image based on the latest version of Fedora, and installs the Nginx web server and a custom index.html file.

1. Building a container with Buildah CLI: In addition to using the Buildah API, you can also build containers using the Buildah command-line interface (CLI). For example, to build a simple container using the CLI, you can run the following command:
    

```python
$ buildah bud -t mycontainer .
```

This command builds a new container image based on the Dockerfile in the current directory, and tags it with the name "mycontainer".

# **üìç** Conclusion

In conclusion, containers have revolutionized the way software is developed, deployed, and managed. They provide a lightweight, portable, and scalable solution that makes it easy to run applications in any environment. Docker is one of the most popular container platforms available today, but it is not without its challenges. Buildah is an open-source alternative to Docker that provides developers with more flexibility and control over the container build process.

Buildah is a powerful tool that provides developers with a lightweight and flexible solution for building containers. With Buildah, developers can customize the container build process to meet their specific needs and can build containers quickly and easily without the need for a Docker daemon. If you are looking for a more flexible and customizable solution for container building, Buildah is worth exploring.
