# Happiness is realized within, rather than achieved on the outside

# üìç Introduction

As we go through life, we often search for happiness in external circumstances. We believe that if we can just land that dream job, find the perfect partner, or look like the people in magazines, we'll finally be happy. However, this external focus can lead to a never-ending cycle of searching for happiness, and it can often leave us feeling frustrated and unfulfilled.

The truth is that happiness is not something that can be achieved through external circumstances alone. Instead, it's something that we can realize within ourselves. This means that we can cultivate a sense of contentment and fulfillment that is independent of our external circumstances.

The ancient wisdom of yoga and meditation can help us to realize this truth. These practices teach us to focus on our internal states and develop a positive mindset. By cultivating gratitude, practising daily meditation, and developing healthy habits, we can learn to find happiness within ourselves.

As a recent graduate, you may be feeling pressure to find the perfect job or achieve a certain level of success. However, it's important to remember that true happiness is not dependent on external circumstances. Instead, it's something that we can cultivate within ourselves.
