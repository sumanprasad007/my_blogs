# **Introduction:**

Are you a DevOps or a Linux Enthusiast, spending countless hours crafting and editing scripts in Vi or Vim? Well, fret not! You're in for a treat, as we've compiled a treasure trove of essential commands and tips that will supercharge your productivity and save you loads of time.

## **🌟 Vi and Vim: What's the Buzz About?**

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty commands, let's understand what makes Vi and Vim so special:

* **Vi** is one of the most venerable text editors in the Linux world, offering simplicity and efficiency.
    
* **Vim** (Vi Improved) is an extended and enhanced version of Vi, loaded with powerful features and capabilities.
    

## **🔍 Searching and Navigation Made Easy**

When you're knee-deep in code, efficient navigation is key. Vi and Vim provide a plethora of commands to make your life easier:

* 🚶‍♂️ **Navigation**: Move seamlessly with `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l`, or use shortcuts like `0` and `$`.
    
* 📜 **Scrolling**: Press `Ctrl + f` to scroll forward or `Ctrl + b` to scroll backward.
    

## **✍️ Supercharged Editing**

Editing text in Vi and Vim is a breeze with these essential commands:

* 📝 **Inserting Text**: Use `i` to insert before the cursor, `I` to insert at the line's beginning, and `a` to append after the cursor.
    
* ➕ **Adding Lines**: Employ `o` to open a new line below the cursor, and `O` for a line above.
    
* ✂️ **Deleting**: Quickly delete characters with `x`, or the entire line with `dd`.
    
* 📋 **Copying and Pasting**: Yank (`yy`) and paste (`p`) text effortlessly.
    

## **🔍 Search and Replace Like a Pro**

DevOps tasks often involve replacing code snippets. Vi and Vim have you covered:

* 🔎 **Searching**: Initiate a search with `/`, and press `n` to find the next occurrence.
    
* 🔄 **Replacing**: Replace text with `:s/old/new/g` for the current line or `:%s/old/new/g` for the entire file.
    
* **Jump to Line Number**:
    
    * Use `:<line_number>` to jump to a specific line in the file (e.g., `:25` to go to line 25).
        

## **💾 Saving and Exiting**

Don't forget to save your precious scripts:

* 💾 **Save**: Use `:w` to save your work.
    
* 🚪 **Quit**: Exit with `:q`, or save and exit with `:wq` or `:x`.
    
* 🚫 **Force Quit**: In case of emergencies, use `:q!` to exit without saving.
    

## **🔁 Undo and Redo**

Mistakes happen, but Vi and Vim have got your back:

* 🔙 **Undo**: Press `u` to undo your last change.
    
* 🔄 **Redo**: Redo an undone action with `Ctrl + r`.
    

## **🖼️ Visual Mode**

Unlock the power of Vi and Vim's Visual Mode for text manipulation:

* ✏️ Enter Visual Mode with `v`, select text, and perform operations like yanking or deleting.
    

## ➕ Some More **Tips:**

* **Indent Multiple Lines**:
    
    * Select multiple lines in Visual Mode (`Shift + V`) and then press `>` to indent them right or `<` to indent them left.
        
* **Repeat Previous Change**:
    
    * The `.` (period) key repeats the last change you made. This is incredibly useful for applying the same action multiple times.
        
* **Replace Mode**:
    
    * Enter Replace Mode by pressing `R`. You can then type over the existing text, and it will replace characters as you type.
        
* **Quickly Navigate to Matching Parentheses**:
    
    * Place your cursor on a parenthesis, and press `%` to jump to its matching parenthesis.
        
* **Toggle Case**:
    
    * Select text in Visual Mode and press `~` to toggle the case (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa).
        
* **Copy to System Clipboard**:
    
    * On systems with clipboard support, you can copy selected text to the system clipboard with `"+y` (e.g., `"+yy` to copy a line).
        
* **Switch Case Sensitivity in Search**:
    
    * When searching with `/`, you can toggle case sensitivity with `\c` and `\C`. For example, `/search\c` performs a case-insensitive search.
        
* **Repeat Last Search**:
    
    * Press `n` to repeat the last search forward or `N` to repeat it backward.
        
* **Navigate by Word**:
    
    * Move between words quickly by pressing `w` to move forward or `b` to move backward.
        
* **Delete to End of Line**:
    
    * In Normal Mode, use `D` to delete from the cursor position to the end of the line.
        
* **Execute Shell Commands**:
    
    * You can execute shell commands from within Vim by typing `:!` followed by the command (e.g., `:!ls` to list files).
        
* **Navigate Undo Tree**:
    
    * Use `g-` and `g+` in Normal Mode to navigate backward and forward through the undo tree.
        
* **Swap Two Words**:
    
    * In Normal Mode, place your cursor on the first word and type `daw` to delete the word and `p` to paste it after the cursor position.
