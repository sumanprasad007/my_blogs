The process was surprisingly straightforward and efficient, and I was able to complete it within a short amount of time. I began by creating a new S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console, and then I uploaded my static website files to the bucket using the "Add files" button. I then enabled static website hosting by going to the "Properties" tab of the bucket and clicking on "Static website hosting."

Finally, I tested my website by opening the endpoint URL provided by AWS, and I was thrilled to see my website up and running on the web! This was an exciting moment for me as it demonstrated how easily and quickly I could set up a website using AWS services.
