# **üìç Introduction**

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub that enables developers and DevOps engineers to streamline their workflows and automate various tasks within their repositories. As a DevOps engineer, understanding and effectively utilizing GitHub Actions is essential to optimize the software development and deployment process. In this blog, we will explore some common interview questions and scenario-based challenges related to GitHub Actions to help you ace your next DevOps interview and enhance your skills.

**1\. What are GitHub Actions?**

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD solution provided by GitHub, allowing developers and DevOps engineers to automate various tasks within their repositories. For example, whenever a new code change is pushed to a repository, GitHub Actions can automatically trigger a workflow that runs tests, builds the application, and deploys it to a staging environment for further testing.

### **How do GitHub Actions work?**

GitHub Actions are defined in YAML files within the repository. Here's an example of a simple workflow that runs on every push to the main branch:

```plaintext
name: Build and Test
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

In this example, the workflow has one job called 'build', which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. The steps include checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with npm, and running tests.

### **What are some advantages of using GitHub Actions?**

* **Integration with GitHub:** GitHub Actions seamlessly integrates with repositories and pull requests. For example, when a pull request is opened, workflows can be triggered to perform checks on the code changes.
    
* **Scalability:** GitHub Actions can handle large-scale projects with parallel job execution. For instance, a workflow can be set up to run tests concurrently on different platforms or run multiple deployment tasks simultaneously.
    
* **Extensive Marketplace:** GitHub Actions has a vast collection of community-contributed actions available in the GitHub Marketplace. For example, you can find actions for deploying applications to various cloud providers, sending notifications, and more.
    
* **Flexibility:** GitHub Actions provides customization options for building personalized workflows. For instance, you can create complex workflows with conditionals, loops, and reusable actions.
    
* **Easy Setup:** GitHub Actions run on GitHub's servers, eliminating the need for additional infrastructure. For instance, you can set up continuous integration and deployment for your projects without maintaining separate build servers.
    

### **Scenario: Building and Testing a Node.js Application**

In a Node.js project, you can use GitHub Actions to automate the build and test process. Here's an example workflow that does this:

```plaintext
name: Node.js CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

This workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js version 14.x, installs project dependencies using npm, and runs the tests with `npm test`.

### **How do you handle secrets in GitHub Actions?**

Handling secrets securely is crucial in GitHub Actions. Secrets can be stored in the repository settings as encrypted environment variables. For example, if your workflow requires an API key to interact with a third-party service, you can set it as a secret in the repository settings and access it within the workflow like this:

```plaintext
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to Production
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: |
          # Use the $API_KEY in your deployment script
          deploy-script.sh $API_KEY
```

By referencing `secrets.API_KEY`, GitHub Actions will automatically inject the secret value during the execution of the workflow.

### **Deploying a Dockerized Application to AWS**

In this scenario, we'll automate the deployment of a Dockerized application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using GitHub Actions.

```plaintext
name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Login to AWS ECR
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: user/repo:latest
      - name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        uses: aws-actions/elastic-beanstalk-deploy@v1
        with:
          environment-name: "YourEnvironmentName"
          app-name: "YourAppName"
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch. It checks out the code, logs in to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using AWS credentials stored as secrets, builds and pushes the Docker image to ECR, and finally deploys the image to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### **How can you customize GitHub Actions with your own Docker container?**

GitHub Actions provides the option to use custom Docker containers in workflows. For instance, if you have a specialized environment or specific tooling requirements, you can define your Docker container for use in the workflow. Here's an example:

```plaintext
name: Custom Docker Container
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  custom-container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: docker://your-custom-image:tag
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Other steps using your custom Docker container
```

In this example, the workflow specifies a custom Docker container using the `container` keyword. The subsequent steps within the job will be executed inside the specified container.

### **Managing Pull Request Workflow**

Here's an example workflow that runs tests and linters on a pull request, and notifies the team about the status:

```plaintext
name: Pull Request Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Notify team
        if: ${{ always() }}
        run: |
          # Use a notification service to alert the team about the status of the pull request
          notify-team.sh
```

This workflow runs on every pull request to the main branch. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, runs tests, lints the code, and finally, notifies the team about the status.

### **What are self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions?**

Self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions allow you to run workflows on your infrastructure. For example, if you have specific security requirements or need access to on-premises resources, you can set up self-hosted runners to execute workflows.

### **Scenario: Using Self-Hosted Runners**

In this scenario, you need to set up self-hosted runners to handle workflows that require specific tools available only on your local infrastructure.

* Set up a self-hosted runner on your local server by following the official GitHub documentation.
    
* Modify the workflow YAML to use the self-hosted runner:
    

```plaintext
name: Self-Hosted Runner Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  self-hosted-runner-job:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Other steps that require self-hosted runner capabilities
```

In this example, the workflow uses the `self-hosted` runner, which will execute the steps on the previously set up self-hosted runner.

# **üìç Conclusion**

GitHub Actions offers a wide range of capabilities to automate various tasks in your software development workflow. By understanding how to define workflows, use custom Docker containers, handle secrets securely, and leverage self-hosted runners, you can supercharge your CI/CD process as a DevOps engineer. Remember, real-life examples and hands-on experience are key to mastering GitHub Actions and excelling in your DevOps career.
