Stress is a common experience for many people, including graduates who are navigating the challenges of starting a new chapter in their lives. According to Sadhguru in his book "Inner Engineering," there are several reasons why stress can arise, including lack of awareness, overthinking, fear and anxiety, inability to handle emotions, lack of purpose and direction, and unhealthy lifestyle habits.

## 🔹 Overthinking:

When we engage in excessive thinking or worry, it can lead to stress and anxiety.

## 🔹 Fear and anxiety:

Fear and anxiety can be major sources of stress, causing us to feel overwhelmed and unable to cope.

## 🔹 Inability to handle emotions:

When we are unable to manage our emotions, it can lead to stress and other negative consequences.

## 🔹 Lack of purpose and direction:

Without a sense of purpose or direction in life, we can feel lost and stressed.

As a graduate, you may experience stress for various reasons. For example, you may feel uncertain about your career path, anxious about your financial situation, or overwhelmed by the demands of transitioning to a new phase of life. Whatever the cause of your stress, it's important to acknowledge and address it to prevent it from taking a toll on your mental and physical health.

One way to overcome stress as a graduate is to cultivate self-awareness. By paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, you can start to identify patterns and triggers that contribute to stress. For instance, if you tend to overthink or worry excessively, you may benefit from practising mindfulness or meditation to quiet your mind and stay present at the moment. Alternatively, if you struggle with managing your emotions, you could explore techniques such as journaling or therapy to help process and regulate your feelings.

Another way to combat stress as a graduate is to focus on building a sense of purpose and direction in your life. This might involve setting clear goals for your career or personal development, connecting with your passions and interests, or finding ways to contribute to your community. By having a sense of purpose, you can feel more grounded and motivated, which can help alleviate stress and anxiety.

Finally, taking care of your physical health can also be key to reducing stress as a graduate. This might involve getting regular exercise, eating a balanced and nutritious diet, getting enough sleep, and minimizing unhealthy habits such as excessive alcohol or drug use. By prioritizing your physical well-being, you can boost your resilience and energy, which can help you better cope with the challenges of graduate life.

# 📍 Conclusion:

In conclusion, stress is a common experience for many graduates, but it's not an inevitable part of the journey. By cultivating self-awareness, building a sense of purpose and direction, and taking care of your physical health, you can overcome stress and achieve greater well-being as you navigate this exciting new phase of your life.
