# **📍 Introduction**

Hey everyone! I'm thrilled to share my latest YouTube video where I demonstrate the process of deploying my 🔥Portfolio Website🔥 using a variety of powerful AWS Developer Tools. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this video is packed with valuable insights, practical demonstrations, and step-by-step implementation.

Throughout the video, I guide you through each stage of the deployment process, using captivating images to illustrate the steps. We'll start by leveraging AWS CodeBuild, a fully managed build service that compiles the website's source code. I'll show you how to configure CodeBuild to automate the build and packaging process, ensuring consistency across different environments.

Next, we'll dive into AWS CodeDeploy, an automated deployment tool. You'll learn how to create a deployment group and set up the necessary permissions using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). With CodeDeploy, managing deployments, rollbacks, and monitoring becomes effortless, ensuring smooth and reliable updates.

To streamline the entire deployment workflow, we'll explore AWS CodePipeline, a continuous delivery service. Together, we'll create a pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment stages. CodePipeline seamlessly integrates with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy, providing a streamlined and efficient deployment process.

Throughout the video, I'll also share various best practices and tips for optimizing the website's performance and security. You'll gain insights into using Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to isolate your website's resources and configure access controls. Additionally, I'll demonstrate how to leverage Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing static assets and hosting the website.
