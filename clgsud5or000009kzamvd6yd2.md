It was an amazing Mechanical Keyboard and a T-shirt that had "Train With Shubham" printed on it. I was thrilled and felt incredibly thankful for this wonderful gesture. This gift serves as a reminder of the journey I went through during the challenge and the things I learned from all the LinkedIn connections.
