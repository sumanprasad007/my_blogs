# üë©‚Äçüíª Continuous Deployment using AWS CodePipeline for a web application

# üìç Introduction

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of computing services, including Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises instances. It provides a consistent deployment experience and allows you to easily deploy your code in a reliable, repeatable way.

## üîπ Steps:

The steps for deploying a web website using AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodePipeline, and deploying on an EC2 instance:

1. Create an EC2 instance and install any necessary software or dependencies for your web application.
    
2. Create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group that targets your EC2 instance.
    
3. Create a CodePipeline with a source stage that pulls your website code from a version control system such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit.
    
4. Add a build stage to your pipeline that builds your website code, such as by running a build script or compiling assets.
    
5. Add a deploy stage to your pipeline that deploys your website code to the CodeDeploy deployment group you created in step 2.
    
6. Configure the pipeline to run automatically when changes are pushed to your version control system.
    
7. Monitor the deployment in the CodeDeploy console and verify that your website is running correctly on your EC2 instance.
    
8. Optionally, configure a rollback strategy in CodeDeploy to quickly revert to a previous version of your website in case of issues or errors.
    

Note: These are the high-level steps and the actual process may involve additional steps or configurations depending on the specific requirements and setup of your web website. In the next upcoming blog, I'll share the step-by-step breakdown that I have used to create this project...

# üìç Conclusion

In conclusion, deploying a Python web application using AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodePipeline, and an EC2 instance involves several steps, including setting up the necessary AWS resources, configuring the CodeDeploy agent, creating a CodePipeline, and defining the deployment process. With these steps, the development team can automate the deployment process, ensure that the deployment is reliable, and minimize downtime. By following these steps, developers can also take advantage of the benefits of continuous deployments, such as faster time to market and the ability to quickly respond to customer feedback.
