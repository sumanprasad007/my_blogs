# **üìç** Introduction:

The world of cloud computing and DevOps is abuzz with the recent announcement from Amazon Web Services (AWS) regarding a new charge for public IPv4 addresses. This change, set to take effect on February 1, 2024, carries profound implications for cloud architects, DevOps engineers, and businesses at large. In parallel with this new pricing structure, AWS is also introducing a valuable tool, Public IP Insights, to enhance monitoring, analysis, and auditability of public IPv4 address usage. Let's dive into why this news matters and explore the steps to harness the power of Public IP Insights. üöÄ

### **üîç The Significance of AWS' New Public IPv4 Address Charge:**

1. **Resource Scarcity and Cost Efficiency:** As IPv4 addresses become increasingly scarce, the associated costs have surged by over 300% in the last five years. This new charge of $0.005 per IP per hour prompts cloud architects and DevOps teams to think innovatively, optimize resource utilization, and consider the transition to IPv6.
    
2. **Cloud Budgeting and Planning:** The new pricing structure calls for meticulous budgeting and cost projection for organizations relying on AWS. DevOps practitioners will need to assess and allocate resources more strategically, fostering a culture of efficient resource management.
    
3. **IPv6 Adoption Acceleration:** Beyond cost considerations, the introduction of charges underscores AWS' commitment to driving IPv6 adoption. Modernization efforts in this direction not only conserve IPv4 resources but also align with the evolving landscape of internet protocols.
    

### **üîç Introducing Public IP Insights for Enhanced Visibility:**

In a bid to provide users with greater visibility and control over their public IPv4 address usage, AWS is rolling out an invaluable tool: **Public IP Insights**. This feature is integrated within the Amazon VPC IP Address Manager, and it comes at no additional cost. Public IP Insights offers a multifaceted approach to monitoring, analysis, and security enhancement.

### **üîç Key Features of Public IP Insights:**

* **Comprehensive Breakdown:** Gain a holistic view of your public IP types and Elastic IP (EIP) usage. Understand how resources are distributed and identify optimization opportunities.
    
* **Advanced Filtering:** Employ multiple filtering options to dissect data and uncover patterns. This empowers you to pinpoint specific areas for improvement.
    
* **Security Profile Enhancement:** Beyond resource management, Public IP Insights provides a deeper understanding of your security profile. Identify potential vulnerabilities and bolster your cloud infrastructure's defenses.
    

### **üîç Leveraging Public IP Insights: Steps to Get Started:**

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
    
2. Navigate to the Amazon VPC dashboard.
