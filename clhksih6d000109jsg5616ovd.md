## **üìç** Introduction:

DevOps is an approach that emphasizes collaboration between Development and Operations teams to improve the software development process. As a DevOps Engineer, you will need to be familiar with various AWS services that can help you deploy, manage and monitor applications. In this post, we will discuss the fundamental services that every DevOps Engineer should be aware of.

## **üîπ** Amazon VPC:

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that enables you to deploy your servers and databases in an isolated state. It provides you with complete control over your virtual networking environment, including IP address range, subnets, and route tables. With Amazon VPC, you can create a secure and private network that can be accessed only by authorized users or instances. For example, you can use Amazon VPC to deploy a web application and a database server in two separate subnets. This will ensure that your database is not directly accessible from the internet, providing an additional layer of security.

## **üîπ** Amazon EC2:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With Amazon EC2, you can quickly deploy virtual servers to host your application. You can choose from a variety of instance types based on your application's requirements. Additionally, you can use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This helps to improve application availability and scalability.

## **üîπ** S3 Storage:

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that can be used to store and retrieve data, including image files and customer data logs. S3 provides durability, availability, and scalability to your data. You can use S3 to store backups, archives, and other data that you do not need to access frequently. You can also use S3 as a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets to your users.

## **üîπ** Amazon RDS:

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that supports several database engines, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Amazon Aurora, and Microsoft SQL Server. With Amazon RDS, you can quickly create, manage, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS takes care of database administration tasks, such as backups, patching, and scaling. This allows you to focus on developing your application instead of managing the underlying infrastructure.

## **üîπ** AWS IAM:

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that enables you to create and manage users, groups, and permissions for accessing AWS resources. You can use IAM to grant different levels of access to your resources based on the roles and responsibilities of your team members. For example, you can create a user with read-only access to your S3 bucket and another user with full access to your EC2 instances.

## **üîπ AWS** CI/CD Services:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) services are used to automate the software delivery process. AWS provides several services that can be used to implement CI/CD pipelines, including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. These services can be used to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your application.

## **üîπ** Networking Services:

AWS provides several networking services that can be used to connect your applications to the internet and other AWS services. One of the key networking services is Amazon Route53, which is a domain name system (DNS) service that can be used to route user requests to your applications running on AWS or on-premises. Other networking services include Virtual Private Gateway, Direct Connect, and Elastic Network Interfaces.

## **üîπ** Databases Services:

In addition to Amazon RDS, AWS provides several other database services that can be used to store and manage data in the cloud. For example, Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that can be used to store and retrieve data in real-time. Amazon Elasticache is a managed in-memory data store service that can be used to improve the performance of your applications by reducing the response time of your queries. With Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Elasticache, you can build highly scalable and performant applications that can handle millions of requests per second.

## **üîπ AWS** CloudFormation:

AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables you to create and manage your infrastructure as code. With CloudFormation, you can create templates that define the resources you need, including EC2 instances, RDS instances, and VPCs. You can then use these templates to create and manage your infrastructure in a repeatable and consistent way. CloudFormation also provides versioning and rollback capabilities, which can help you to quickly and easily recover from failed deployments.

## **üîπ** Container Services:
