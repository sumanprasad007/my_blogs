Good morning connections, It's day 18 of #90days challenge, and **it's important to understand the pre-requisites needed to get started with DevOps.**

DevOps is a powerful practice that can help organizations to deliver high-quality software quickly, reliably and securely, but it can also be overwhelming for beginners. Here are some key pre-requisites that you should consider before diving into DevOps.

1. Understanding of software development: DevOps is a collaboration between development and operations teams, so a basic understanding of software development is important. This includes knowledge of programming languages, version control systems, and software development methodologies.
    
2. Familiarity with automation tools: DevOps relies heavily on automation to streamline the software development and deployment process. Beginners need to have a basic understanding of tools such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef for infrastructure automation, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, and Docker for containerization.
    
3. Knowledge of cloud computing: DevOps practices often involve deploying applications on cloud platforms, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. A basic understanding of cloud computing, including cloud deployment models and services, is important for successful DevOps implementation.
    
4. Strong communication and collaboration skills: DevOps is all about collaboration between development and operations teams, so strong communication and collaboration skills are a must. This includes the ability to work well with others, understand the perspectives of others, and communicate effectively.
    
5. Understanding of security: DevOps practices often involve deploying applications in a fast and continuous manner, so it's important to understand security best practices and how to integrate security into the DevOps workflow.
    

In conclusion, these are some of the key pre-requisites that beginners should consider before diving into DevOps. While it may seem overwhelming at first, DevOps can be a rewarding practice that can help organizations to deliver better software to customers. With the right knowledge and skills, anyone can get started with DevOps and start making a positive impact on their organization.
