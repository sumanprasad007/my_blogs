# DevOps Culture & it's different Roles

## 📍 Introduction

DevOps is a way of working in the technology world where developers and IT operations work together to create amazing software. They use special tools and processes to make sure that the software is created quickly, efficiently, and with high quality. Here are some common job roles in DevOps, along with examples and tools they use:

## DevOps Engineer

👨‍💻 A DevOps Engineer is responsible for designing and deploying software systems, as well as maintaining the processes and tools that help developers and IT operations work together. For example, a DevOps Engineer might use Docker containers to package software applications and Ansible to automate the deployment process. They might also use tools like Nagios or New Relic to monitor the performance and reliability of the systems they deploy.

## Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

👨‍💻 An SRE makes sure that the software systems that are running in production are always working well, running smoothly, and can handle a lot of users. For example, they might use tools like Datadog or AppDynamics to detect and fix problems and tools like PagerDuty or VictorOps to respond to any problems that happen.

## Infrastructure Engineer

👨‍💻 An Infrastructure Engineer is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that supports software deployment. This might include managing data centers, cloud-based infrastructure, and underlying networking and storage systems. For example, an Infrastructure Engineer might use Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to manage cloud-based infrastructure and Kubernetes to manage containers.

## Operations Engineer
