# **üìç Introduction:**

The SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model is a structured approach to software development that helps teams plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain software. The model consists of several phases, each with its own set of activities, that must be completed to create a successful software product.

# **üìç 3 Phases:**

The three phases that a DevOps Engineer is typically involved in are:

## **üîπ**Build Phase:

In this phase, the DevOps Engineer is responsible for developing and generating the executable files that make up the software application. The engineer will use various programming languages and tools to create the software components that will later be compiled into executable files. Examples of executable files include .dll (Dynamic Link Library), .jar (Java Archive), .war (Web Archive), and .apk (Android Package).

## **üîπ**Test Phase:

Once the software components have been developed and compiled into executable files, the DevOps Engineer will work with the Quality Assurance (QA) team to test the application for bugs, vulnerabilities, and loopholes. The DevOps Engineer will assist in the automation of testing procedures to help speed up the process and ensure that the application meets the required quality standards.

## **üîπ**Deploy Phase:

Once the application has been tested and any issues have been fixed, the DevOps Engineer will be responsible for deploying the application to production. This involves promoting the tested application to the production environment and making it available for end users to access.

## **üîπ Examples:**

Examples of SDLC models that incorporate DevOps principles include Agile and DevOps. These models emphasize the importance of collaboration, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation in the software development process to help teams work more efficiently and deliver high-quality software products promptly.

# **üìç Conlusion:**

In conclusion, the SDLC model is a structured approach to software development that helps teams plan, design, build, test, deploy, and maintain software. DevOps Engineers play a critical role in the SDLC model, specifically in the Build, Test, and Deploy phases. They are responsible for developing, testing, and deploying the software application to production, ensuring that it meets the required quality standards and is available for end users to access. By incorporating DevOps principles into the SDLC model, such as collaboration, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation, teams can work more efficiently and deliver high-quality software products in a timely manner
