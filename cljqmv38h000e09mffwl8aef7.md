# **üìç Introduction**

The concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) has become increasingly popular in the software development industry, as organizations strive to streamline their software delivery processes and reduce errors. CI/CD are practices that aim to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software, enabling developers to deliver new features and bug fixes to production faster and with greater confidence. Implementing CI/CD pipelines has been made easier by the usage of cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## **‚úî** Features of Project:

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Comprehensive Study:** The Report provides a comprehensive analysis of the steps involved in implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS. The study covers all the key components of a CI/CD pipeline and explains how they can be automated using various AWS services. This allows organizations to understand the end-to-end process of creating a CI/CD pipeline, from code management to deployment.

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† The Benefits of using AWS:** The Report highlights the key benefits of using AWS to create a CI/CD pipeline. These benefits include increased speed, as automation reduces the time taken for manual processes, reduced errors, as automation eliminates human error, improved collaboration, as developers can work together on the same source code,

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† scalability:** Organizations can scale their infrastructure as required, and enhanced security, as AWS implements various security measures to ensure the safety of customer data.

**4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Case Study:** The Report includes a case study that demonstrates how a complete CI/CD pipeline can be created using AWS. This provides organizations with a practical example of how the different components of a CI/CD pipeline can be automated using AWS services. The case study also provides recommendations for organizations looking to adopt a similar approach, allowing them to learn from the experience of others.

**5.¬†¬†¬†¬† AWS Services:** The Report explores the various AWS services that can be used to automate the different stages of a CI/CD pipeline, such as GitHub for code management, AWS CodeBuild for building and testing code, and AWS CodeDeploy for deployment. The Report explains how each of these services can be used and how they integrate to create a complete CI/CD pipeline.

**6.¬†¬†¬†¬† Recommendations:** The Report ends with a list of suggestions for businesses wishing to use Amazon to construct a full CI/CD pipeline. These suggestions include advice on best practices, such as how to choose the proper Amazon services, how to assure security, and how to grow the infrastructure to meet the requirements of the software delivery process.

**7.¬†¬†¬†¬† Security:** The Report also addresses the security aspect of using AWS for a CI/CD pipeline, highlighting the various measures implemented by AWS to ensure the safety of customer data. These measures include network security, data encryption, and access control.

**8.¬†¬†¬†¬† Scalability:** While discussing the scalability of utilising Amazon for a CI/CD pipeline, the Report emphasises how simple it is for businesses to extend their infrastructure to match the needs of their software delivery process. With AWS services, businesses can scale their infrastructure up or down as needed without having to make substantial initial hardware expenditures.

## **‚úî Tools involve in the project:**

1. **AWS CodeBuild:** This completely managed-to-build service compiles source code, performs tests, and generates software packages that are prepared for deployment. You won't need to set up, maintain, or grow your build servers anymore, freeing you your time to focus on creating code rather than taking care of infrastructure.
    
2. **AWS CodeDeploy:** It is a fully-managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of computing services, including Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, and on-premises servers. It eliminates the need for you to manually deploy your application code and ensures that your deployments are consistent, error-free, and repeatable.
    
3. **AWS CodePipeline:** It is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It orchestrates and automates the different stages of your release process, including building, testing, and deploying your code changes.
    
4. **AWS S3:** It is a cloud-based object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides scalable and secure storage for a wide range of use cases, such as data backup, content distribution, and application data storage. In the context of a CI/CD pipeline, S3 is often used for storing artifacts and deploying applications
    
5. **AWS EC2**: It is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud. For developers, it is intended to make web-scale cloud computing simpler. To meet the unique requirements of the project, EC2 instances can be deployed with a number of operating systems and programmes.
    
6. **AWS IAM:** It is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users. IAM allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and control their access to AWS services and resources using permissions. You can use IAM to manage who can sign in to your AWS account, create and manage AWS users, groups, and roles, and assign granular permissions to users and groups to access specific resources.
    
7. **AWS VPC:** It is a service that lets you launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you define. This virtual network is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud, giving you complete control over your virtual networking environment. With VPC, you can create a virtual network topology that closely resembles a traditional network that you might operate in your own data centre, with multiple subnets, routing tables, and access control policies.
    
8. **AWS CloudWatch:** It is a monitoring and management service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for applications, infrastructure, and services running on the cloud. CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms. It allows users to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.
    
9. **GitHub:** It is a popular web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate on and manage software projects using the Git version control system. It provides a range of features for source code management, including version control, issue tracking, project management, code review, and collaboration tools.

i. Installing CodeDeploy on EC2

Steps to follow along:

1. Connect to the Instance using:
    
    * Putty & Putty-gen Software
        
    * Command Prompt or PowerShell by following the below:
        
    * Connect to the SSH client and copy the Example text.

1. Now first, update the instance, and then we will create a shell script to install the CodeDeploy agent. It's even possible by entering single commands one by one, but it's always a good practice to execute using the shell script.
    
2. Save and exit from the vi (editor) by pressing `esc`, `:`, `wq!`.
    
3. Now, we will execute the shell script to install the CodeDeploy Agent.
