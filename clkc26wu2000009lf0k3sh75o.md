## **📍** Introduction:

In this blog, we will compare the Azure Repo with GitHub and understand when to use what, even we will explore the scenarios in which each version control system has its own identity. At the end, we have a comparison table to understand the usability of each in sorted form. 🎉

### **🔹 Ownership and Hosting:**

* **Azure Repos**: Part of Azure DevOps, 🌩️ tightly integrated with Microsoft's Azure cloud services.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your development team uses Azure DevOps for the whole SDLC and enjoys seamless integration with Azure Pipelines and other Azure services.
        
* **GitHub**: 🌐 Independent and free to roam, the heart of the open-source community.
    
    * Real-Life Example: You're a passionate open-source contributor, and GitHub is your go-to platform to collaborate with global developers on exciting projects.
        

### **🔹 Pricing:**

* **Azure Repos**: Free for limited private repos, but watch out for extra costs with more users and repos.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your startup team enjoys Azure Repos' initial free private repositories but might need to budget for additional private repos as your team grows.
        
* **GitHub**: 🆓 Free for public repos, but private ones come at a cost based on users and repos.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your personal projects, like your cool portfolio website, are on public GitHub repos, while your top-secret side project requires a private repository.
        

### **🔹 Integration with CI/CD:**

* **Azure Repos**: 🔄 Seamlessly synced with Azure Pipelines for smooth CI/CD workflows.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Every time you push code to Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines automatically runs tests and deploys your web app to Azure App Service. Magic!
        
* **GitHub**: 🚀 GitHub Actions are here to help you build the ultimate CI/CD pipeline.
    
    * Real-Life Example: You've set up GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy your Node.js app to AWS Lambda whenever you push changes to your GitHub repo.
        

### **🔹 Development Community:**

* **Azure Repos**: 🌱 Growing community, but not as massive as GitHub's galaxy of developers.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your organization's internal projects thrive on Azure Repos, where your dev team collaborates and shares code securely.
        
* **GitHub**: 🌍 A universe of devs, where open-source projects shine like stars.
    
    * Real-Life Example: You've joined an exciting open-source project on GitHub, where contributors from around the world come together to build something amazing.
        

### **🔹 Enterprise Features:**

* **Azure Repos**: 🏢 Rock-solid enterprise features with Active Directory integration and top-notch security.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your enterprise uses Azure Repos to manage multiple projects with strict access controls, ensuring data security and compliance.
        
* **GitHub**: 💼 Enterprise options available, but some premium features might come at a cost.
    
    * Real-Life Example: Your company opts for GitHub Enterprise, leveraging advanced features like SAML SSO and Data Loss Prevention to protect your valuable code.
        

### Choose **Azure Repos** if... 💡

* You're an Azure DevOps aficionado, seeking the perfect match for the rest of your DevOps tools. 🔗
    
* Your small team needs a cozy private repo home without breaking the bank. 💰
    
* Security and compliance are your top priorities, and you need the ultimate enterprise-grade experience. 🔒
    

### Choose **GitHub** if... 💡

* Open-source projects are your passion, and you want to contribute to the bustling GitHub community. 🤝
    
* You crave the freedom to roam across platforms, independent from any specific cloud service. 🐾
    
* GitHub Actions and existing integrations are your go-to tools for CI/CD wizardry. 🧙‍♀️
