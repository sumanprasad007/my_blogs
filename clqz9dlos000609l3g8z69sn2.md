### Introduction:

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the marriage of creativity and innovation has reached new heights. 🌐 Recently, Microsoft Bing AI and DALL·E 3, two cutting-edge AI technologies, collaborated to produce a breathtaking 3D illustration. This collaboration resulted in the creation of a personalized, animated character seamlessly integrated into the social media world, specifically atop the LinkedIn logo. 🤖🎨

### The Prompt:

"Create a 3D illustration of an animated character sitting casually on top of a social media logo 'LinkedIn'. The character must wear formal modern clothing such as a suit and tie and dress shoes. The background of the image is a social media profile page with a username 'Prasad Suman Mohan' and a profile picture that matches the animated character. Make sure the text is not misspelled. Use the face from the LinkedIn profile 'profile\_url' as a reference for the character's face." 📸👔👞
