Are you tired of hitting snooze and feeling groggy throughout the day? I know I was until I realized the power of morning habits and how they can set the tone for the rest of the day. As IT professionals, we often face challenges and setbacks that can weigh on our minds. But, instead of letting those negative thoughts linger, why not set intentions for the day and strive for personal growth and change?

For me, Mondays are the perfect day to plan out my tasks for the week and break them down into smaller, daily goals. I use a variety of tools, such as google calendar & google task manager, to stay organized and on top of my tasks. And at the end of each day, I review my progress and identify what worked and what didn't, so I can continue to improve.  
One specific morning routine that has helped me overcome procrastination is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. As soon as my alarm goes off, I start counting down from 5 and as soon as I hit 1, I get out of bed immediately without any other thoughts. This really helps me to avoid getting caught up in the snooze cycle.  
Another great tool I use is the Alarmy app, which helps me to wake up early and stay on track with my morning routine.

These are just a few of my learnings for the day, and I hope it will be helpful for you as well. Remember, it's important to be gentle with ourselves as we work to make these habits effortless. Let's strive to improve ourselves and our productivity, one day at a time. PEACE ðŸ¤—
