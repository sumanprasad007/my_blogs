Objective: 🎯 Deploy a .NET 6 application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio.

### 📢 Prerequisites: Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

✔️ Visual Studio 2022 or later with the .NET 6 SDK and AWS Toolkit installed.

✔️ An AWS account and basic knowledge of AWS Elastic Beanstalk and .NET 6 Web Applications.

Step 1: Build a .NET 6 Web Application with Visual Studio

If you don't have a .NET 6 based web app already, you can create one by following these steps:

🔧 Create a new [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Razor Pages web app.

🔧 Name your application (e.g., cloudiofy-web-app-001).

🔧 Build your .NET 6-based demo application.

### 🔄 Step 2: Deploy the .NET 6 Application in Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio

1. Open your .NET 6 application in Visual Studio.
    
2. If you haven't already, sign in to your AWS account using AWS Explorer in Visual Studio.
    
3. Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Publish to AWS Beanstalk (Legacy).."
    
4. In the Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk wizard:
    
    * Select the "AWS Credentials" and "Region" where you want to deploy.
        
    * Choose "Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment" and click "Next."
        
5. Configure your environment:
    
    * Choose a unique application and environment name.
        
    * Check the availability of the "URL."
        
6. Configure AWS options:
    
    * Select the "Container Type" and "Instance Type."
        
    * Choose whether to "Create Key Pair" and click "Next."
        
7. Configure permissions:
    
    * Keep the default options and click "Next."
        
8. Configure deployment options:
    
    * Choose the "Build Configuration," "Framework," and "Reverse Proxy (nginx)."
        
9. Review your configurations and click "Deploy."
    
10. Wait for the deployment process to complete. Once the environment status is healthy, your deployment is successful.
    

1. Verify the environment status from the AWS console under the "Elastic Beanstalk" service and click on "Environment."
    

### 🔄 Step 3: Test Your Application Congratulations!

🎉 You have successfully deployed your .NET 6 application in Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio. Now, let's test it:

1. Open a web browser and access your application using the provided URL.
    
2. Ensure that your application is functioning as expected.
    

Note:

If necessary, you can terminate the deployed environment from Visual Studio or manually delete the created resources from the AWS console.

# **📍** Conclusion:

In this tutorial, we learned how to deploy a .NET 6 application in Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio. 🚀 By following the step-by-step instructions, you can easily deploy your applications and take advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered by AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
