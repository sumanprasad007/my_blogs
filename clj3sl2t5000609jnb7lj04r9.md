## **📍** Introduction:

In this blog post, we will explore Azure Test Plans, a powerful tool for managing and executing tests in your software development projects. We will cover test plans, test suites, and test cases, as well as creating and managing test plans, executing tests, and tracking test results. By the end of this post, you will have a solid understanding of Azure Test Plans and be able to implement efficient testing strategies in your projects.

### **🔍** Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases

* Test Plans: A test plan is a collection of test suites and test cases designed to validate the functionality of a specific software release or iteration. Test plans help organize and manage testing efforts, ensuring that all required tests are executed and tracked.
    
* Test Suites: A test suite is a collection of test cases that are related to a specific feature, component, or requirement. Test suites help organize test cases and make it easier to execute and track tests for specific areas of the application.
    
* Test Cases: A test case is a set of steps, inputs, and expected results used to validate a specific functionality or requirement. Test cases are the building blocks of testing and provide a detailed description of what needs to be tested and how to test it.
    

### **🔍** Creating and Managing Test Plans

To create and manage test plans in Azure Test Plans, follow these steps:

Step 1: Sign in to your Azure DevOps account and navigate to your project.

Step 2: Click on "Test Plans" in the left-hand menu.

Step 3: Click on the "New Test Plan" button.

Step 4: Enter a name and description for your test plan, and select the iteration it is associated with.

Step 5: Click "Create" to create your test plan.

To add test suites and test cases to your test plan, follow these steps:

Step 1: In your test plan, click on the "New" button and select "New Test Suite."

Step 2: Enter a name and description for your test suite, and click "Create."

Step 3: Click on the test suite you just created, and click on the "New" button to create a new test case.

Step 4: Enter a title for your test case, and click "Create."

Step 5: In the test case details, add the test steps, inputs, and expected results.

Step 6: Click "Save" to save your test case.

### **🔍** Executing Tests and Tracking Test Results

To execute tests and track test results in Azure Test Plans, follow these steps:

Step 1: In your test plan, click on the test suite containing the test cases you want to execute.

Step 2: Select the test cases you want to run, and click on the "Run" button.

Step 3: In the Test Runner, follow the test steps, inputs, and expected results for each test case.

Step 4: As you execute each test case, mark the test as "Passed" or "Failed" based on the actual results.

Step 5: If a test case fails, you can add a comment, attach a screenshot, or create a bug directly from the Test Runner.

Step 6: Click "Save and close" to save your test results and close the Test Runner.

Test results are automatically tracked in Azure Test Plans, allowing you to monitor the progress and quality of your testing efforts. You can view test results by clicking on the "Results" tab in your test plan, or by generating test result reports in the "Analytics" section of your project.

## **📍** Conclusion:

In this blog post, we have explored Azure Test Plans, including test plans, test suites, and test cases, as well as creating and managing test plans, executing tests, and tracking test results. By implementing efficient testing strategies using Azure Test Plans, you can ensure that your software is thoroughly tested and meets the required quality standards.
