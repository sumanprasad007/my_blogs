## Introduction to Ansible Callback Plugins

In the symphony of automation, communication is key. Ansible Callback Plugins are the conductors, allowing you to customize how Ansible communicates and provides feedback during playbook execution. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of Ansible Callback Plugins, understanding their significance, and mastering the art of tailoring automation feedback to suit your needs.

## Understanding Ansible Callback Plugins

### What are Callback Plugins?

Callback Plugins in Ansible are a mechanism for extending or modifying the default behavior of the playbook run. They allow you to capture events during playbook execution and take custom actions based on those events.

### Why Use Callback Plugins?

* **Custom Output**: Tailor the output format to your team's preferences.
    
* **Notifications**: Integrate with external systems for alerts or reporting.
    
* **Logging**: Capture detailed logs for auditing or debugging.
    

## Learning about Callback Plugins

### Built-in Callback Plugins

Ansible comes with a variety of built-in callback plugins, such as `default`, `json`, `yaml`, etc. These plugins control the default output format of Ansible.

### Viewing Available Callback Plugins

To view the available callback plugins, run:

```plaintext
ansible-doc -t callback -l
```

This command lists the available callback plugins.

### Enabling a Callback Plugin

To enable a callback plugin, add the following line to your `ansible.cfg` file:

```plaintext
[defaults]
callbacks_enabled = <callback_plugin_name>
```

Replace `<callback_plugin_name>` with the desired plugin name.

## Customizing Output and Notifications

### Creating a Custom Callback Plugin

You can create your own custom callback plugin in Python. Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
# my_callback_plugin.py
from ansible.plugins.callback import CallbackBase

class CallbackModule(CallbackBase):

    def v2_playbook_on_play_start(self, play):
        print(f"Starting play: {play.get_name()}")
```

### Using the Custom Callback Plugin

To use your custom callback plugin, specify it in your `ansible.cfg` file:

```plaintext
[defaults]
callbacks_enabled = my_callback_plugin
```

### Tailoring Output

Custom callback plugins allow you to tailor the output to your team's preferences. You can capture specific events and display information in a format that suits your needs.

### Integrating Notifications

Callback plugins also provide a way to integrate Ansible with external systems for notifications. For example, you can send alerts to a messaging platform or trigger external actions based on playbook events.

## Conclusion

Ansible Callback Plugins are the artists' brushes in your automation palette, allowing you to paint a customized picture of your playbook execution. By understanding and harnessing the power of callback plugins, you ensure that your automation feedback is not just informative but also tailored to meet your team's requirements.
