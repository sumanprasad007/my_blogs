# **üìç** Introduction:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development. They help streamline the development process, reduce errors, and ensure that your application is always up-to-date. In this blog, we'll walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using GitHub Actions. We'll cover everything from creating a simple Java application to deploying it using GitHub Actions.

# üìù Pre-requisites:

* A GitHub account
    
* Basic knowledge of Java and Maven
    

### üöÄ Step 1: Create a Java application

First, let's create a simple Java application using Maven. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-java-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

This command generates a basic Java application with the following structure:

```plaintext
my-java-app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ java
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com
    ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
    ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.java
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ java
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AppTest.java
```

### üöÄ Step 2: Initialize a Git repository

Navigate to the **my-java-app** directory and initialize a Git repository:

```plaintext
cd my-java-app
git init
```

Create a **.gitignore** file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository:

```plaintext
echo "target/" > .gitignore
```

Commit the initial project files:

```plaintext
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### üöÄ Step 3: Create a GitHub repository

Create a new repository on GitHub and push your local repository to it:

```plaintext
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-java-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### üöÄ Step 4: Set up GitHub Actions

Create a new directory called **.github/workflows** in your project:

```plaintext
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create a new file called **ci-cd.yml** inside the **.github/workflows** directory:

```plaintext
touch .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

Open the **ci-cd.yml** file and add the following content:

```plaintext
name: Java CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'adopt'

    - name: Cache Maven packages
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.m2
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
        restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2

    - name: Build and test with Maven
      run: mvn clean verify

    - name: Package application
      run: mvn package

    - name: Deploy
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: echo "Deploy your application here"
```

This GitHub Actions workflow does the following:

* Triggers on push and pull request events to the **main** branch
    
* Checks out the repository
    
* Sets up JDK 11
    
* Caches Maven packages for faster builds
    
* Builds and tests the application using Maven
    
* Packages the application
    
* Deploys the application (replace the **echo** command with your deployment script)
    

### üöÄ Step 5: Commit and push the GitHub Actions workflow

Add the new GitHub Actions workflow to your repository:

```plaintext
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
git push
```

Now, whenever you push changes to your **main** branch or create a pull request, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build, test, and deploy your Java application.

# **üìç** Conclusion:

In this blog, we've demonstrated how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using GitHub Actions. By following these steps, you can automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your Java projects, ensuring that your application is always up-to-date and error-free. Happy coding!
