## Step-by-step guide

For implementing Continuous Integration for a Python application using AWS DevOps tools:

1. **Create an AWS account:** If you don't already have an AWS account, create one by visiting the AWS website and signing up for a new account.
    
2. **Set up CodeCommit:** Create a CodeCommit repository to host the code for the Python application. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
    
3. **Write the code**: Write the Python code for the application and commit the changes to the CodeCommit repository.
    
4. **Set up CodeBuild:** Create a CodeBuild project to build and test the code. In the CodeBuild project, specify the CodeCommit repository as the source code location, configure the build environment, and specify the build commands to compile the code and run the tests.
    
5. **Set up CodeGuru:** Create a CodeGuru repository assessment to analyze the code for best practices and coding standards. In the CodeGuru repository assessment, specify the CodeCommit repository as the source code location.
    
6. **Set up CodeReview:** Create a CodeReview review to provide feedback on code changes. In the CodeReview review, specify the CodeCommit repository as the source code location.
    
7. **Set up CodeDeploy:** Create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group to deploy the code to a production-ready environment. In the CodeDeploy application and deployment group, specify the CodeBuild output as the source code location and configure the deployment settings.
    
8. **Set up CloudWatch:** Create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the health of the application. In the CloudWatch alarm, specify the CloudWatch metrics to track and the alarm actions to take when the thresholds are breached.
    
9. **Test the pipeline**: Push a change to the CodeCommit repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline. Verify that the code is built, tested, analyzed, reviewed, and deployed as expected.
