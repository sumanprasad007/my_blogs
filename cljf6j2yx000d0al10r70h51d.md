## **üìç** Introduction:

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) offer a powerful solution for deploying and managing virtualized workloads in the cloud. With Azure VMs, you can provision virtual machines on demand, tailor them to your specific requirements, and run applications and workloads in a scalable and flexible manner. In this blog post, we will delve into the key features of Azure Virtual Machines and provide step-by-step instructions, along with code snippets and real-time examples, to help you create and manage a Windows Server VM on Azure. Let's dive in and unlock the full potential of Azure VMs! üöÄ

### üñ•Ô∏è Key Features of Azure Virtual Machines:

1. Versatile VM Types: Azure VMs offer a wide range of options, enabling you to choose the right VM type for your workload. From general-purpose VMs to compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and GPU-enabled instances, Azure provides the flexibility to meet your specific needs.
    
2. Scalability and Elasticity: With Azure VMs, you can easily scale your infrastructure up or down based on demand. Azure provides autoscaling capabilities, allowing you to dynamically adjust the number of VM instances based on predefined rules or metrics, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
    
3. High Availability: Azure VMs offer built-in high availability features to ensure your applications stay up and running. You can leverage availability sets or availability zones to distribute VM instances across fault domains and update domains, minimizing downtime during planned or unplanned maintenance events.
    
4. Virtual Machine Extensions: Azure VMs support various extensions that enhance functionality and ease management tasks. You can install extensions for monitoring, diagnostics, antivirus, backup, and more, simplifying the administration of your VMs.
    
5. Integration with Azure Services: Azure VMs seamlessly integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Virtual Networks, Azure Load Balancer, Azure Storage, and Azure Backup. This enables you to build comprehensive solutions and leverage the full power of the Azure ecosystem.
    

### üöÄ Real-Time Example: Provisioning a Windows Server VM on Azure

Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine:

* Sign in to the Azure portal ([portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com)) and navigate to the Azure Virtual Machines service.
    
* Click on "Create a virtual machine" and select the desired VM configuration, such as the operating system, size, and region.
    

Step 2: Configure Networking and Storage:

* Set up networking options, such as virtual network, subnet, public IP address, and network security groups.
    
* Choose the appropriate storage type (managed disks or Azure Files) and configure storage account settings.
    

Step 3: Install Dependencies and Deploy Applications:

* RDP into the newly created Windows Server VM using the provided credentials.
    
* Install required software and dependencies within the VM, such as web servers, databases, or development tools.
    
* Deploy your applications and configure them to run within the VM environment.
    

Step 4: Manage and Monitor your VM:

* Utilize Azure Monitor to gain insights into the performance and health of your VM.
    
* Set up alerts, view performance metrics, and configure diagnostic settings to streamline management and troubleshooting.
    

Code Snippets: Here are some code snippets to assist you in the VM provisioning process:

### **üîç** Azure CLI command to create a Windows Server VM:

```plaintext
az vm create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --name <vm-name> \
  --image Win2019Datacenter \
  --admin-username <admin-username> \
  --admin-password <admin-password> \
  --size Standard_D2s_v3 \
  --location <location>
```

### **üîç** PowerShell script to install IIS on a Windows Server VM:

```plaintext
$vmName = "<vm-name>"
$resourceGroupName = "<resource-group-name>"
$script = 'Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server'
Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vmName -CommandId 'RunPowerShellScript' -ScriptPath $script
```

### **üîç** Azure CLI command to enable autoscaling for a VM:

```plaintext
az monitor autoscale create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --name <autoscale-settings-name> \
  --resource <vm-name> \
  --min-count <min-vm-count> \
  --max-count <max-vm-count> \
  --count <default-vm-count> \
  --email-administrator <email-address> \
  --operator 'GreaterThan' \
  --metric 'Percentage CPU' \
  --threshold 70 \
  --time-grain 'PT1M'
```
