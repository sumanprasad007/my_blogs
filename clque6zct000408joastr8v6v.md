## Introduction to EC2 Instance Types 🔍🔧

### Diverse Instances for Different Demands:

* AWS offers a variety of EC2 instances optimized for distinct use cases.
    
* Naming Convention: e.g., m5.2xlarge, where 'm' is the instance class, '5' is the generation, and '2xlarge' signifies the size within the class.
    

## EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose 🌐⚖️

### Ideal for Versatile Workloads:

* Suited for diverse workloads like web servers or code repositories.
    
* Balanced resources: Compute, Memory, and Networking.
    
* Example: t2.micro – a General Purpose EC2 instance used in the course.
    

## EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized 💡💻

### Powering Compute-Intensive Tasks:

* Tailored for tasks demanding high-performance processors.
    
* Use Cases:
    
    * Batch processing workloads.
        
    * Media transcoding.
        
    * High-performance web servers.
        
    * Scientific modeling, machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers.
        

## EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized 🚀📊

### Fast Performance for Memory-Intensive Workloads:

* Designed for tasks processing large datasets in memory.
    
* Use Cases:
    
    * High-performance relational/non-relational databases.
        
    * Distributed web scale cache stores.
        
    * In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence).
        
    * Real-time processing of big unstructured data.
        

## EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized 📈📚

### High-Performance Storage-Intensive Tasks:

* Suited for tasks requiring high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.
    
* Use Cases:
    
    * High-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
        
    * Relational & NoSQL databases.
        
    * Cache for in-memory databases (e.g., Redis).
        
    * Data warehousing applications.
        

## EC2 Instance Types: Example Comparison 📊🔍

| Instance | vCPU | Mem (GiB) | Storage | Network Performance | EBS Bandwidth (Mbps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t2.micro | 1 | 1 | EBS-Only | Low to Moderate | \- |
| t2.xlarge | 4 | 16 | EBS-Only | Moderate | \- |
| c5d.4xlarge | 16 | 32 | 1 x 400 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gbps | 4,750 |
| r5.16xlarge | 64 | 512 | EBS Only | 20 Gbps | 13,600 |
| m5.8xlarge | 32 | 128 | EBS Only | 10 Gbps | 6,800 |

*Note: t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month).*
