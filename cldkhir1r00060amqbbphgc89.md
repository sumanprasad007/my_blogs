# Balance between Work and Personal life

Good morning connections! Day 2 of [#90days](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=90days&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7020955805696823296)  
  
As a fresher in this field, I have come to understand the importance of maintaining a balance between work and personal life in order to stay motivated and productive. Setting goals and creating a morning routine has been a game-changer for me, but it's also important to make time for self-care and relaxation.  
  
I am still in the process of making these practices a regular part of my daily routine, and I believe that consistency and patience are key. One way I am trying to balance my work and personal life is by setting clear boundaries and sticking to a schedule. I make sure to set specific times for when I will start and end work, and also schedule in time for exercise, meditation, and spending time with loved ones. This helps me to stay focused and productive during work hours, and also allows me to fully relax and recharge when I'm not working.  
  
Another tip that I have found helpful is to avoid multitasking and instead focus on one task at a time. This not only increases productivity but also reduces stress and allows for a better work-life balance.  
  
As a fresher, I am still learning and growing in this field and I understand the importance of taking care of ourselves both physically and mentally in order to perform at our best. Prioritizing a healthy work-life balance will not only improve our productivity and efficiency but also lead to a happier and more fulfilled life.
