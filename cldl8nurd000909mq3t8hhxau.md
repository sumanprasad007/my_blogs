# Need of DevOps in the IT

**Good morning, everyone! As we approach Day 17 of our #90days challenge**, it's time to talk about one of the most important concepts in modern software development: DevOps.

DevOps is a practice that aims to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. This collaboration between teams helps organizations to deliver high-quality software quickly, reliably and securely.

Why do we need DevOps?

1. Faster Delivery: DevOps helps to automate many of the manual processes involved in software development and deployment. This allows teams to deliver software faster and more frequently.
    
2. Improved Quality: DevOps practices, such as continuous testing and continuous integration, help to identify and fix bugs earlier in the development process. This leads to improved software quality and a better user experience.
    
3. Better Collaboration: DevOps encourages collaboration between development and operations teams. This helps to break down silos and improve communication, which leads to more efficient and effective software development.
    

What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that focus on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. It emphasizes the use of automation and tools to streamline the software development and deployment process. DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment, help to automate many of the manual processes.

A DevOps example:

Consider a software development team working on a new app. In the past, the team might have written code, tested it and then handed it over to the operations team for deployment. With DevOps, the development and operations teams work together from the start. The development team writes code and tests it, but also automates the deployment process. The operations team monitors the app in production and provides feedback to the development team. This collaboration helps to ensure that the app is delivered quickly and reliably.

In conclusion, DevOps is a critical practice for organizations looking to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably. By bridging the gap between development and operations, DevOps helps teams to work more efficiently and effectively, delivering better software to customers.
